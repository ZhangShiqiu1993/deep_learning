# CNN images classification

---

+ Built a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** by using *TensorFlow* and classified images from the *CIFAR-10* dataset
+ Implemented `normalization` on images, and `one-hot encoding` on labels
+ Created Convolutional Network Model with `convolution`, `max pool`, `dropout`, `flatten` and `fully-connect` layers
+ Got over 75% accuracy on test data
