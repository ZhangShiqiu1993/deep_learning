# RNN Generates TV Script 

+ Built a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** by using `TensorFlow` and generated tv scripts for `Simpsons`
+ Applied `embedding` to input data and generated embedded sequence.
+ Stacked `LSTM Cell` in a `Multi-RNN Cell`
+ Applied a fully connected layer with a linear activation
+ Got final loss less 0.019
