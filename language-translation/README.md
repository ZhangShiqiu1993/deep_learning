# language translation through RNN

+ Implemented a `sequence to sequence` model, to translate English sentence to French in real time
+ Created an `encoder` RNN layer by using two layers of `LSTM` cell with `dropout`
+ Implemented a encoder to embed the data into sequence
+ Built an `embedding` layer as a lookup table
+ Implemented `training decoder` layer and `inference decoder` layer with shared weights
+ Used `fully-connected` layer for output
